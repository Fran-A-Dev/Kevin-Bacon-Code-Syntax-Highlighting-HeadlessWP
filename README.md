# Headless WordPress with Code Block Pro and Next.js

This repository demonstrates how to integrate the **Kevin Batdorf Code Block Pro** plugin with a headless WordPress setup using **Next.js**. The project shows how to query WordPress editor blocks (including code blocks with syntax highlighting) using **WPGraphQL** and display them in a Next.js front-end.

## Features

- **Code Block Pro**: Renders code blocks with VS Code themes and provides a copy-to-clipboard button.
- **WPGraphQL**: Uses GraphQL to fetch post content, including custom editor blocks.
- **Next.js**: Server-rendered Next.js app using the **App Router** to display WordPress content headlessly.
